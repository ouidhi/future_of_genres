**Historical Context:**  

From 2018 to 2024, hip-hop experienced a slow decline in top chart representation. While hip-hop remains the most listened-to genre, its market share decreased from 28.2% in 2020 to 26.8% in 2023. This decline is attributed to factors such as market saturation, evolving listener preferences, and the rise of other genres like country and rock. Despite this, established artists like **Kendrick Lamar** and **Drake** continue to achieve significant success, indicating that while the genre's overall popularity may be waning, individual artists still resonate strongly with audiences.

**Forecast Insight:**  

The model suggests a continued decline or plateau through 2027. This may reflect shifting listener preferences toward more genre-fluid, emotional, or ‚Äúalternative‚Äù styles that deviate from traditional hip-hop formulas. The increasing role of **AI in music creation** and its potential to replace human artists could impact hip-hop's future, especially regarding copyright and the nature of art.

## üé§ Pop

**Historical Context:**  

There's a peak around early 2020, reaching 24. Other smaller peaks and troughs are visible throughout the period. The popularity of pop music tends to decrease around the middle of the year due to several factors. One reason is the lack of significant new releases, especially during the summer when artists often take breaks or focus on touring. This can leave a void in the music landscape, causing listeners to turn to older, more established music or other genres. 

Another factor is the potential for artists to release new material in the fall, which can be timed with the upcoming holiday season and a renewed focus on new music. Finally, the rise of "recession pop" and the increasing awareness of socio-economic issues among young people may also lead to a shift in focus towards alternative musical styles. 

**Forecast Insight:**  
The forecast attempts to capture and extrapolate this seasonal pattern into the future, predicting continued oscillations within the observed range. The expanding confidence interval is a critical feature, emphasizing that while short-term predictions might be more reliable, the uncertainty associated with forecasting "Pop Music" popularity increases substantially the further into the future the predictions extend.

## üé§ Country

**Historical Context:**  

From early 2018 to late 2019, there's a significant peak, reaching close to 100 in late 2019, followed by a sharp decline. Country music saw a rise in popularity in 2019, primarily due to the mainstream success of **"Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X**, which effectively coined the phrase "country rap" and sparked a shift towards country fusion.¬†This was further fueled by the growing influence of social media platforms like TikTok, where country music has found a new audience, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials.

**Forecast Insight:**  
The forecast indicates that this fluctuating pattern is expected to continue into the mid-2020s, with no immediate return to the high levels seen in 2019, but also no sharp decline. The forecast also suggests a degree of uncertainty, as indicated by the shaded confidence interval.

## üé§ Rock

**Historical Context:** 

Through 2019 and into mid-2020, there's a general downward trend, with values fluctuating mostly between 25 and 30, and some dips below 25. In 2021, rock music experienced a period of perceived stagnation, likely due to a combination of factors, including the pandemic's impact on touring and live music, the decline of traditional radio, and the rise of other genres like pop, hip-hop, and EDM.¬†While some new rock music was emerging, the genre didn't have the same widespread momentum and energy as in previous years.

**Forecast Insight:**  

The forecast shows an initial slight dip in early 2025, followed by a relatively stable period around the high 20s. Towards late 2026 and early 2027, the forecast shows a slight upward trend in the central prediction.

**Historical Context:**
