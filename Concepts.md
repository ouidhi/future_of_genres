## Time series analysis
Time series analysis = understanding the past.
We understand the patterns and errors in the past data that we currwntly have. This includes following steps:

1. Plotting the series

2. Decomposition - trend, seasonality, noise/ residual

3. Checking if data is stationary

## Time series forecasting
Time series forecasting = predicting the future.
This is where we use the results of time-series analysis to create a forecast of the future. This includes following steps:

1. Selecting a model

   
2. Splitting training and test data

   
3. Evaluating the model performance

   
4. Plotting the predictions
   
5. Creating a forecast for future 

## Time-series components
A given time series is thought to consist of three systematic components including level, trend, seasonality, and one non-systematic component called noise.
